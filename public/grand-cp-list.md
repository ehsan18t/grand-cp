# 🏆 The Ultimate Competitive Programming Roadmap
## From 800 Codeforces Rating to Candidate Master (2200+)

**655+ Problems | Multi-Platform | Serial Progression**

This roadmap is designed for someone with ~800 Codeforces rating who wants to systematically level up. Follow problems **serially from #1 onwards** - the order is carefully crafted so each problem builds on previous concepts.

---

## 📚 Philosophy & How to Practice

Based on research from top competitive programmers (E869120, -is-this-fft-, TheScrasse):

### The Two Pillars of Improvement
1. **"What to Think"** - Know standard problems, techniques, and patterns
2. **"How to Think"** - Build paths to solutions through practice

### Golden Rules
1. **NO JUMPING AROUND** - The order is crucial. Earlier problems prepare you for later ones.
2. **STRUGGLE BEFORE SOLUTIONS** - Spend at least 30-60 minutes on a problem before seeking hints. The struggle is where learning happens.
3. **AVOID SELF-DECEPTION** - Don't pretend to solve problems. If you read an editorial, the problem is "spoiled" - you didn't truly solve it.
4. **UPSOLVE RELIGIOUSLY** - After contests, solve at least one problem you couldn't solve during the contest.
5. **ASK "WHY"** - After solving, ask: *What was the key insight? Why didn't I see it faster?*
6. **IMPLEMENT EVERYTHING** - Reading solutions is not solving. You must code and get AC.

### After Reading an Editorial (Reflection Questions)
*From -is-this-fft-'s "Self-Deception" Blog:*

When you finally read an editorial (after genuinely struggling), ask yourself:
- **"Why didn't I think of this?"** - Identify the specific insight you missed
- **"What observation wasn't intuitive to me?"** - Note it for future problems
- **"Is this technique standard?"** - If yes, add it to your toolkit
- **"What similar problems could this solve?"** - Generalize the approach

### Avoiding Self-Deception
⚠️ **Warning Signs You're Fooling Yourself:**
- Solving only easy problems and avoiding hard ones ("biased problem selection")
- Reading hints after 5 minutes instead of struggling
- Saying "I would have solved it" after reading editorial
- Rushing through problems for quantity over quality
- Only solving problems with tags visible

✅ **What to Do Instead:**
- Solve problems slightly above your comfort zone
- Hide problem tags and ratings when possible
- Spend 60-90 minutes on hard problems before ANY hints
- After editorial, implement from scratch without looking

### Virtual Contest Practice
- Do **at least 1 virtual contest per week** on Codeforces
- Choose contests from your rating ± 200
- Treat it like a real contest (no distractions, timed)
- **Upsolve all problems within your rating reach** after the virtual

### Time Guidelines per Problem Difficulty
| Difficulty | Think Time Before Hints |
| ---------- | ----------------------- |
| Easy       | 15-20 minutes           |
| Medium     | 30-45 minutes           |
| Hard       | 60-90 minutes           |
| Very Hard  | 2+ hours (over days)    |

### Platform Legend
- 🟢 **LC** = LeetCode
- 🔵 **CF** = Codeforces  
- 🟡 **CSES** = CSES Problem Set
- 🟠 **AC** = AtCoder
- ⚪ **Other** = SPOJ, etc.

## 🏁 Final Notes

1. **Consistency > Intensity**: 1-2 hours daily beats 10 hours on weekends
2. **Contest Participation**: Enter at least 1-2 rated contests per week
3. **Virtual Contests**: Do Codeforces virtual contests for practice
4. **Track Progress**: Mark problems as solved, note key insights
5. **Don't Rush**: It's okay to spend days on hard problems
6. **Plateau is Normal**: Rating stalls are expected; keep grinding

**Expected Timeline:**
- Phase 0-1: 2-3 months
- Phase 2-3: 3-4 months  
- Phase 4-5: 4-6 months
